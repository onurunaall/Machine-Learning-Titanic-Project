The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most shocking and evil events in history. Many people died due to the equipment deficiencies on the ship and the mistakes of the crew. However, when a study was made about this, it was seen that when people were grouped according to certain characteristics, some groups had a higher chance of survival than other groups. In this project, data from the Titanic competition, taken from the Kaggle database, were used. These data have been processed first. Then, some data were combined to create more logical results and new results were obtained. In this project, the aim is to predict whether the passengers in the test set survive according to their parameters.

The train.csv file is the input file. The test.csv file is the file containing the data in which the model is tested. The titanic.csv file contains the ML model predictions, i.e. the results, of the data in the test.csv file.
